# **ü©∫ Detection of Lung Infection Using Machine Learning**

**üöÄ Overview:**

The Detection of Lung Infection project utilizes deep learning to analyze X-ray images and detect lung infections such as pneumonia and tuberculosis with high accuracy. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model has been trained to classify infected and non-infected lung images, providing an efficient, automated solution for early diagnosis.
